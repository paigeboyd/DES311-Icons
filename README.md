<h2> Design Brief </h2>
We were tasked with creating an icon set and a single-page website to promote them and allow users to download the set. Complete freedom to decide on the subject of the icons and how the website is styled - provided it is fit for purpose and the icons look like they are a set.


<h2>Landmarks</h2>
I chose to create icons themed around European Landmarks. I created two sets; Day and Night of 8 icons in each.
The landmarks featured are:
- Big Ben: London
- La Sagrada Familia: Barcelona
- Konzerthaus at Gendarmenmarkt: Berlin
- Prague Castle: Prague
- Halászbástya(Fisherman's Bastion): Budapest
- Trevi Fountain: Rome
- Notre Dame: Paris
- Hallgrímskirkja Cathedral: Reykjavik
