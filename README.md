# DES311-Icons
Wanderlust Icon Set created for DES311 Creative Entrepreneurship module.

We were tasked with creating an icon set and a single-page website to promote them and allow users to download the set!

I chose to create icons themed around European Landmarks. I created two sets; Day and Night of 8 icons in each.
The landmarks featured are:
- Big Ben: London
- La Sagrada Familia: Barcelona
- Konzerthaus at Gendarmenmarkt: Berlin
- Prague Castle: Prague
- Halászbástya(Fisherman's Bastion): Budapest
- Trevi Fountain: Rome
- Notre Dame: Paris
- Hallgrímskirkja Cathedral: Reykjavik
